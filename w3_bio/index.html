                    <u>Hello!</u> My name is <b>Cooper</b> and I am a second term software engineering student at <i>NEIT!</i> 
                    My biggest hobby is playing Minecraft and I have a considerable amount of hours. 
                    A fun fact about me is that I used to stream Minecraft content on Twitch. 
                    I've been interested in computers for a long time, and by coming to NEIT, I am pursuing a career in what I enjoy. 
                    I also have 2 dogs named Brody and Noah, who are Briards and both over 90 pounds.
                </p>
